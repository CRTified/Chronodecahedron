## What is this?

This device is a physical time-tracking device to easily track how long you work on what.

It consists of a 3d-printed dodecahedron (12 sided platonic solid) and uses an 
accelerometer to detect which side faces up.

By using [esphome](https://esphome.io) as a platform, it is then able to expose 
the detected side as a sensor over MQTT or other protocols.

Check out [the model on a360.co](https://a360.co/3KxAjle). The `STL` and `f3z` are available in this repo.

## Assembly

### 0) Sourcing

 - Source the parts on your own
 - Print the parts with whatever material you prefer

### 1) Threaded Inserts

 - Melt the two M3 inserts into the holes of the printed `hull.stl`
 - Melt the two M2 inserts into the two blind holes of the printed `base.stl`
 
![`base.stl` with threaded inserts](./assets/base_inserts.jpg)

### 2) Electronics

 - (Optional: Desolder the JST-PH header for the battery)
 - Desolder the LED on the GY-521 (white component next to the x-axis silkscreen)

 - Stick both resistors with one lead through `GPIO33` and make a solder connection 
 - Solder the other lead of one of the 100k立 resistors to the `+`-pad of the battery connector
 - Stick the other lead of the second resistor through `GND`, **but don't connect it yet**

![Lolin32 with Resistors and solder joint on `GPIO33`](./assets/lolin_resistor.jpg "Result")

 - Put a piece of jumper wire (~6cm) through `GND`, now solder both the resistor and wire to GND
 - Solder another short piece of jumper wire (~2cm) on `INT`of the GY-521
 - Break away one of the pins of the pin header (you will have one single pin and a row of 5)
 - Solder the single pin on VCC of the GY-521, the remaining row on the pins `SCL` to `ADO`

![GY-521 with pin row soldered to it](./assets/gy_header.jpg "Expected Result")
 
 - Solder the other end of the long jumper wire to `GND` of the GY-521 (shown here without Board on the other side)
 
![GY-521 with pin row and cables soldered to it](./assets/gy_header_wire.jpg "Expected Result")
 
 - Solder the GY-521 into `3V` to `GPIO17` of the Lolin32 Lite (This will leave `GPIO22` and `GPIO16` unconnected)
   - Make sure that it's relatively parallel to the Lolin32 Lite
 - Solder the other end of the short jumper wire to `GPIO13` of the Lolin32 Lite
 - Cut the pins on the back of the lolin32 flush

![Finished Lolin32 Lite](./assets/lolin_solder.jpg "Finished soldering")

- (If you removed the JST-PH jack: Solder the battery to the pads))

### 3) Firmware

 - Modify the `yml`-files in the `esphome` directory to your needs (especially `secrets.yml`)
 - Connect the Lolin32
 - Run `esphome run chrono.yml` in that directory
 - Check that it works as expected (Side detection, battery level, battery charging)
   - The battery level might require fine-tuning. Measure the actual battery voltage level and compare it to the raw reported one.
 
### 4) Assembly

 - Use the M2 screws to attach the Lolin32 to the `base.stl`
 
![Base with Lolin32 lite attached](./assets/base_lolin.jpg "Attached Lolin32 Lite")
 
 - Use the double-sided tape to attach the Li-Ion battery to the inside of the `hull.stl`

![Hull with attached Li-Ion Battery](./assets/hull_liion.jpg "Li-Ion taped to inner wall")
 
 - Close the `base.stl` and the `hull.stl` and connect them with the M3 screws.
